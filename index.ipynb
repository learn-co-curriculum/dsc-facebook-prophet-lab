The idea is straightforward: represent a time series as a combination of patterns at different scales such as daily, weekly, seasonally, and yearly, along with an overall trend. Your energy use might rise in the summer and decrease in the winter, but have an overall decreasing trend as you increase the energy efficiency of your home. An additive model can show us both patterns/trends and make predictions based on these observations.\n", "\n", "The following image shows an additive model decomposition of a time series into an overall trend, yearly trend, and weekly trend.\n", "\n", "![additive model image from Facebook blog post](https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/240830073_526712221759967_1137977873639917627_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=6825c5&_nc_ohc=G52vWPIYHVYAX_JbvbH&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&oh=00_AT-RbQfa68-tBqQhZdpVSUbOiv-t1N6xq9jfqhSGzlRmmQ&oe=630A5A8B)\n", "\n", "*\u201cProphet has been a key piece to improving Facebook\u2019s ability to create a large number of trustworthy forecasts used for decision-making and even in product features.\u201d*"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Let's start by reading in our time series data.
